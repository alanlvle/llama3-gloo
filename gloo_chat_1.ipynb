      "User: what is the recipe of mayonnaise?\n",
      "\n",
      "> Assistant: The classic condiment! Mayonnaise is a thick, creamy sauce made from a combination of oil, egg yolks, acid (such as vinegar or lemon juice), and seasonings. Here's a simple recipe for homemade mayonnaise:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ingredients:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* 2 large egg yolks\n",
      "* 1 tablespoon lemon juice or white vinegar\n",
      "* 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard (optional)\n",
      "* 1/2 cup (120 ml) neutral-tasting oil, such as canola, grapeseed, or sunflower oil\n",
      "* Salt, to taste\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **In a medium-sized bowl**, whisk together the egg yolks, lemon juice or vinegar, and Dijon mustard (if using) until well combined.\n",
      "2. **Slowly add the oil** while continuously whisking the mixture. Start with a very slow, thin stream and gradually increase the flow as the mixture thickens.\n",
      "3. **Whisk constantly** to ensure the oil emulsifies with the egg yolks. You may need to stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl a few times to ensure everything gets fully incorporated.\n",
      "4. **Continue whisking** until the mixture has doubled in volume and has a thick, creamy consistency. This should take about 5-7 minutes.\n",
      "5. **Taste and adjust** the seasoning with salt as needed.\n",
      "6. **Cover and refrigerate** the mayonnaise for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken further.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips and Variations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Use room temperature egg yolks for easier emulsification.\n",
      "* If the mixture breaks or separates, don't worry! Simply start again with a new egg yolk and slowly whisk in the broken mixture.\n",
      "* Add flavorings like minced garlic, grated ginger, or chopped herbs to create different flavor profiles.\n",
      "* For a lighter mayonnaise, use less oil or substitute some of the oil with Greek yogurt or sour cream.\n",
      "* For a vegan mayonnaise, use a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed + 3 tablespoons water) or aquafaba (the liquid from canned chickpeas) instead of egg yolks.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's it! Your homemade mayonnaise is now ready to use as a condiment, sandwich spread, or ingredient in various recipes. Enjoy!\n",
